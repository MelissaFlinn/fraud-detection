= Setting up Kueue resources

NOTE: If you are using the Red Hat Developer Sandbox you can skip this step and move on to the next section, xref:creating-a-workbench.adoc[Create a Workbench].

NOTE: If you do not intend to complete the Distributing training jobs with Training operator section of this {deliverable} you can skip this step and move on to the next section, xref:creating-a-workbench.adoc[Create a Workbench].

In this section, you prepare your {deliverable} environment so that you can use Distributing training with Training operator.

Later in this {deliverable}, you implement a Distributed training job using Kueue for managing job resources. With Kueue, you can manage cluster resource quotas and how different workloads consume them.
